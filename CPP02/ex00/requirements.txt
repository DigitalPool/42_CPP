A **copy assignment operator** is a special function in C++ that defines **what happens when one object is assigned to another object of the same class** using the `=` operator. It’s typically written as:

```cpp
ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other) {
    // copy data from 'other' into 'this' object
    return *this;
}
```

### 1. The Signature
- **`ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other)`**:
  - Returns a reference to the current object (usually `*this`) to allow chaining of assignments (e.g., `a = b = c;`).
  - Takes a **const reference** to another object of the same `ClassName`.

### 2. What It’s Used For
- To **copy the contents** (fields or resources) of `other` into the current instance (`this`).
- Ensures that **both objects** have the correct, consistent state **after** the assignment.
- Needed in cases where you want **custom copy semantics** (e.g., deep copying resources like dynamic memory, file handles, etc.).

### 3. Default Behavior
- If you **don’t** provide your own copy assignment operator, the compiler **generates one** automatically (the so-called **default** version) if it’s needed. This default simply **copies** each non-static member **by value**.
- That works fine if your class only contains simple types (like `int`, `double`, `std::string`).
- If you manage a **resource** that can’t simply be copied by value (like a raw `new`ed pointer, for instance), you’d usually **override** the default version to **do a deep copy** or some specialized logic.

### 4. Typical Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Example {
private:
    int* data;  // pointer to dynamically allocated integer

public:
    // Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
    }

    // Copy constructor
    Example(const Example& other) {
        data = new int(*other.data);
    }

    // Copy assignment operator
    Example& operator=(const Example& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            // 1. free current resource
            delete data;
            // 2. allocate new resource and copy data
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Example() {
        delete data; // clean up
    }

    int getValue() const {
        return *data;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example e1(42);
    Example e2(100);

    e2 = e1;  // calls e2.operator=(e1);
    std::cout << e2.getValue() << std::endl; // prints 42
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation
1. **`Example e1(42);`** creates an `Example` where `data` points to a heap-allocated `int` storing `42`.
2. **`Example e2(100);`** similarly stores `100`.
3. **`e2 = e1;`** calls `Example& Example::operator=(const Example& other)`.
   - We check if `this != &other` to avoid self-assignment issues.
   - We delete `data` in the old object (to prevent a memory leak).
   - We allocate a new integer on the heap and copy the value from `other.data`.
4. Return `*this` allows chaining and denotes that the assignment is done.

That’s it! The copy assignment operator is your **blueprint** for how to **transfer** (or “copy”) data from one object to another **after** they’ve both been constructed.


Final Thoughts
Orthodox Canonical Form means you provide:

Default constructor
Copy constructor
Copy assignment operator
Destructor
The key is that each constructor/operator does what its name implies: the copy constructor copies another object’s data during construction, and the copy assignment operator does so when you do obj1 = obj2;.

For this “Fixed” class, you only have one data member to copy (fp_nbr) and one static constant (frac_bit). If you expand the class to do more complex tasks, this pattern remains the same—always be sure to copy any necessary internal data.
