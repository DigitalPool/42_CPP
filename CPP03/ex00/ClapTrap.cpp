// When ClapTrap attacks, it causes its target to lose <attack damage> hit points.
// When ClapTrap repairs itself, it gets <amount> hit points back. Attacking and
// repairing cost 1 energy point each. Of course, ClapTrap canâ€™t do anything if it
// has no hit points or energy points left. However, since these exercises serve as
// an introduction, the ClapTrap instances should not interact directly with one
// another, and the parameters will not refer to another instance of ClapTrap.
